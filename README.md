# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project  

This project explores **Support Vector Machines** for both **classification** and **regression** tasks.  
The aim was to understand how SVMs work with different kernels and how they perform compared to simple models.  

---

## Dataset  
- For **Regression**: Used the **Tips dataset** from `seaborn.load_dataset`.  
- For **Classification**: Created dataset manually with `sklearn.datasets`.  

---

## Methodology  
1. Model Training (SVM for both regression and classification).  
2. Feature Encoding (required for regression part only).  
3. Model Evaluation using:  
   - r2_score, mean_absolute_error (for Regression)  
   - classification_report, confusion_matrix (for Classification)  
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (with Grid Search CV).  
5. Experiments with different **SVM kernels** (linear, polynomial, rbf, sigmoid).  

---

## What I Learned  
- How SVM works for separating classes with hyperplanes.  
- The role of kernels in transforming feature space.  
- How SVM can also be used for regression (SVR).

## Project Updates  
- I am working on some thimg big, please stay tunned 
- Will try to upload the update by today.  

Thank you everyone
