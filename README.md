## datasets
I imported Tips datasets from seaborn.load_datasets for Regressor
I made the dataset Myself using SKlearn.Dataset

## Methodolody
1. Model Training(I just made this dataset inside the file so no Data CLeaning was Needed and I used Logistic Regression)
2. Feature Encoding (for Regressor only)
3. Model Evaluation (using r2_score,mean_absolute_error (for Regressor),classification_report,confusion_matrix(for Classification) )
4. Hyper Parameter Tuning (Using Grid Search CV )
5. Repeat The Things for Support Vector Classification Problem and  SVM kernels problems

## what I learned
I learned about How the Logistic regression is derived How can we make Predictions By using Logistic Regression

## Project Updates
I am working on some thimg Big please stay tunned I will try to upload by today
Thank you everyone
